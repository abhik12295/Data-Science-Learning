    "Adaboost Machine Learning:\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "- Adaboost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is an ensemble learning technique that combines \n",
    "    multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. \n",
    "- It works by sequentially applying weak classifiers to the training data, \n",
    "    adjusting the weights of misclassified instances so that subsequent classifiers focus more on difficult cases. \n",
    "- The final model is a weighted sum of the individual classifiers, which improves accuracy and reduces bias.\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "- **Boosting Technique**: Adaboost is a boosting algorithm that enhances the performance of weak classifiers.\n",
    "- **Adaptive Weights**: It adjusts the weights of training instances based on the errors of previous classifiers, allowing it to focus on harder-to-classify examples.\n",
    "- **Versatile**: Can be used with various weak classifiers, such as decision trees or linear models.\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Adaboost is less sensitive to outliers compared to some other ensemble methods, as it focuses on misclassified instances.\n",
    "- **Performance**: Often leads to improved accuracy and generalization compared to individual weak classifiers. \n",

    "How it works: Step-by-Step\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Start with equal weights for all training instances.\n",
    "2. **Training Weak Classifiers**: Train a weak classifier on the weighted training data.\n",
    "3. **Error Calculation**: Calculate the error rate of the weak classifier on the training data.\n",
    "4. **Weight Adjustment**: Update the weights of the training instances:\n",
    "   - Increase the weights of misclassified instances.\n",
    "   - Decrease the weights of correctly classified instances.\n",
    "5. **Classifier Weighting**: Assign a weight to the weak classifier based on its error rate (lower error means higher weight).\n",
    "6. **Iteration**: Repeat steps 2-5 for a specified number of iterations or until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "7. **Final Model**: Combine the weak classifiers into a final strong classifier using their assigned weights.\n",
    "8. **Prediction**: For a new instance, each weak classifier votes, and the final prediction is based on the weighted votes of all classifiers.\n",
    "9. **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the final model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.\n",
