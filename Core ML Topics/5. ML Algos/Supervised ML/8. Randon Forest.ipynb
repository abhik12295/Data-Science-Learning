    "- Definition: A Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees \n",
    "            during training and outputs the mode of their predictions for classification \n",
    "            or the mean prediction for regression.\n",
    "- Key Features:\n",
    "    - Combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and control overfitting.\n",
    "    - Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data, which helps in reducing variance.\n",
    "    - Can handle both classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "- Advantages:\n",
    "    - Robust to overfitting, especially with large datasets.\n",
    "    - Handles missing values and maintains accuracy for large datasets.\n",
    "    - Provides feature importance scores, which can be useful for feature selection.  \n",
    "- Disadvantages:\n",
    "    - Can be computationally intensive and slower to predict compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "    - Less interpretable than a single decision tree due to the complexity of multiple trees. \n",
    "- Common Use Cases:\n",
    "    - Classification tasks such as spam detection, fraud detection, and image classification.\n",
    "    - Regression tasks like predicting house prices or stock prices.\n",
    "    - Feature selection and ranking in high-dimensional datasets.\n",

    "    1. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):\n",

    "    2. Boosting:\n",
    "        - Sequentially trains models, where each new model focuses on correcting errors made by previous models.\n",
    "        - Reduces bias and variance, often leading to better performance than bagging.\n",
    "        - Example: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Stacking:\n",
    "        - Combines multiple models (base learners) and uses another model (meta-learner) to make final predictions based on the outputs of the base learners.\n",
    "        - Can leverage the strengths of different algorithms.\n",
    "        - Example: Using logistic regression as a meta-learner for predictions from decision trees and SVMs.\n",
