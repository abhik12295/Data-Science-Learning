    "Hypothesis Testing:\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "    Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population based on a sample. \n",
    "    It involves formulating a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (H1), \n",
    "    then using sample data to determine whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "Hypothesis Testing Mechanism:\n",
    "    1. Formulate the null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (H1).\n",
    "    (Here null hypothesis is a statement of no effect or no difference, \n",
    "    while the alternative hypothesis is what you want to prove.)\n",
    "    2. Choose a significance level (alpha), typically 0.05.\n",
    "    3. Collect sample data and calculate the test statistic.\n",
    "    4. Determine the critical value or p-value based on the test statistic.\n",
    "    5. Compare the test statistic to the critical value or p-value to make a decision.\n",
    "    6. Draw conclusions about the population based on the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    Suppose we want to test whether a new drug is effective in reducing blood pressure.\n",
    "    - Null Hypothesis (H0): The drug has no effect on blood pressure.\n",
    "    - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The drug reduces blood pressure.\n",
    "    - We collect sample data, calculate the test statistic, and compare it to the critical value or p-value.\n",
    "    - If the test statistic exceeds the critical value or the p-value is less than alpha, we reject H0 and conclude that the drug is effective.\n",
